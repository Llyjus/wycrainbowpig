                                    When remind the siamese, we often imagine the modern, long-faced breed. It is the first breed recognized by the world in Asia.

                                <p>
                                    Siamese cats have distinctive colourpoints which is the unique feature to recognize. And it is a result of their emperature-sensitive albinism.

                                <p>
                                    For the modern type, the blue eyes, triangular head, long ears and so on are also their features.
