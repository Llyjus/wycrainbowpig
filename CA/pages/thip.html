                        Obviously, cats also has their own languages.    
                    </p>
                    <p>But I bet you don't know the detailed method of their communications. So let's go on for learning!</p>

                    <input type="checkbox" id="commu_info">
                    <label for="commu_info" id='tpb'>------check here!------</label>

                        <p>
                            The reasons of cats to communicate are variable, including the time when they are annoying, happy or sad. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            It's not well-known that cats seldom communicate by voice when they are facing a cat. Only they are talking to people, they will 'meow'.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Then I'll take time on reading their vocal communications. Let's start!
                        </p>
                        <h2>
                            Purr
                        </h2>
                        <p>
                            This continuous voice comes from their throat, and the reason they make this sounds are not clear.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            BUt often, when they're hungry or happy or anxious, it happens.
                        </p>
                        <p>And in some cases, it is recognized as a signal to encourage the communications.</p>

                        <h2>
                            Meow
                        </h2>
                        <p>
                            For the adult cats, they often make this sound to show they want to attract the humans' attention. But for the little, it's calling their mother.
                        </p>
                        <h2>
                            Chirrup
                        </h2>
                        <p>
                            Often used to call the cat or greet the cat. Also is the way mothers calling their kittens.
                        </p>

                            Chirp
                        </h2>
                        <p>
                            When you hearing that, it most possibly is the cat is chasing the prey!
                        </p>    
                        <p>
                            And there're also some people think it is pretending the birds or other animals hunting.
                        </p>
                        <h2>
                            Growl, spit, hiss
                        </h2>
                        <p>
                            They're angry!!!
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            While they want to kick someone off their place or feel unhappy that will lead to.
                        </p>

                        <h2>
                            Howl, moan, and wail 
                        </h2>
                        <p>
                            It's like anger wails and growls.

                        <p>
                            While they reckon they're threaten, you'll hear that.
